# Find Your Dream Job Application README
Kyle, Bahar, Anna, and Tyler worked together to create an application which, at its core, is a job search engine utilizing two main APIs--Adzuna and Arbeit Now--as well as Materialize CSS, JavaScript, and of course HTML. This project forced us to use all of our skills we have learned so far to create this application, and to style it as we see fit. We utilized HTML to create the static elements of our webpage including the navbar options, the social media icons, the Contact Us form, and the Name, Email, Subject, and Message inputs that allow the user to reach out to us if they have any questions, as well as the Send button. We also used CSS to create the styling for the navbar background, and JavaScript to dynamically generate the job results. We included local storage into the JavaScript code to ensure that the searches are stored in the user's browser history for easier access to previous searches, as well as to ensure that when a user submits their contact information, a message appears in a popup indicating that the team will be getting back to them. Within Adzuna and Arbeit Now, we incorporated the fetch method to properly retrieve the correct information based on what the user was requesting. This could be salary information, job locations within the United States, individual jobs, or more information about companies. In order to access all of this information, I had to create an account with both APIs and utilize a generated API key to access the information that was contained within the APIs. Luckily, Arbeit also contained some code for how to use the fetch method for its API, so I was able to utilize that to make it easier to obtain information from there.
